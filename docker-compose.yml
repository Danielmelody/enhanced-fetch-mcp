version: '3.8'

# This docker-compose.yml is for development/testing purposes
# The MCP server itself doesn't need to run in Docker - it manages Docker containers
# However, you can use this to test the sandbox management in an isolated environment

services:
  # Example: Pre-pull common images for faster sandbox creation
  image-cache:
    image: node:20-alpine
    container_name: mcp-sandbox-cache
    command: sleep infinity
    restart: "no"
    profiles:
      - cache

# Note: The Enhanced Fetch MCP Server runs on your host machine
# and creates/manages sandbox containers on demand.
#
# To use this project:
# 1. Install dependencies: npm install
# 2. Build: npm run build
# 3. Configure Claude Desktop to use dist/index.js
# 4. Restart Claude Desktop
#
# The server will automatically create and manage Docker containers as needed.
